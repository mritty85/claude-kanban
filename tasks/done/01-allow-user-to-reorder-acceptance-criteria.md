## Description
Sometimes the ordering of the Acceptance criteria affects context of the task, but a user is force to delete and recreate criteria if they want them in a specific order. 
We need to develop a editing UI function and UX to allow the user to adjust the ordering of criteria while creating or editing a task

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The reorder element should be away from the trash icon to avoid mistakes
- [ ] A user will need to edit ordering of all tasks together, i don't think clicking edit a single criteria should trigger this
- [ ] Testing the UX of editing as i write this criteria, we could limit ordering to when a single task is being edited. not created
- [ ] on click of the edit a pencil, either hide the checkbox on the left of reveal the dots and handle on the right side of the box
